The purpose of this project is to perform ALS-based Movie Recommendation and K-Means Cluster Analysis on big data using PySpark framework.

The project can be divided into two parts: Task A is Time-splitRecommendation and Task B is User Analysis.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project was executed on a password protected virtual private network. The nodes and clusters used also belong to the VPN.

There are four directories: Code, Data, HPC and Output.
- The "Code" directory includes the python script used to perform our tasks. 
- The "HPC" directory holds the shell file where the memory and core allocations are made. 
- The "Output" folder includes all output files including program logs (output.txt) and graphs. 
- Lastly, the "Data" folder holds the data on which we make analysis and perform model training. We used the MovieLens 20M Dataset accessible here: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/. 

Note: The script files are executed from the root folder.
